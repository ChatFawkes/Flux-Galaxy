# autoDetectCuttableBlocks is a BooleanOption

# blockClassUsingDummyTile is a StringSetOption

# This is the format to add an entry to a StringSetOption:
#   blockClass: +some.block.class.name
# That will add some.block.class.name as a blockClass.
# If something is included by default and you want to remove it, use this format:
#   tileEntityClass: -appeng.me.tile.TileOutputCable
# That will remove appeng.me.tile.TileOutputCable as a tileEntityClass.

# AUTODETECT IS BROKEN ON SERVERS!
# If you're on a server, don't do that. Use autodetect on your client instead, then copy the config file to the server.
